You are adding a NEW FEATURE to an existing site.

Design, layout, HTML structure, and CSS are FINAL and LOCKED.

Rules:
- Do NOT modify existing HTML, CSS, or file structure
- Treat existing DOM as read-only
- Add new UI only inside approved extension containers
- Add new JS as isolated feature modules
- Mark all new code with FEATURE comments
- If a requirement conflicts with existing design, ask instead of changing
