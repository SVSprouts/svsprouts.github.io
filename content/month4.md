# The Brand  
_Naming, logo, and telling the story._

## Who is this for?

Students who have a basic version of their idea and want it to look and sound
like a real project or business.

## Learning goals

- Choose a name that is simple, clear, and easy to say.
- Create a basic logo and visual style.
- Write a short story that explains the problem and your solution.
- Practice a confident one-minute pitch.

## Weekly breakdown

### Week 1 – Naming your idea

- Brainstorm at least 15 names. Use:
  - Mash-ups (Study + Buddy = “StudyBuddy”)
  - Descriptive names (“Homework Helper”)
  - Fun names (“BrainSpark”)
- Check: can you say it in 2 seconds? Can your friend spell it?

Pick 2–3 favorites and ask 3 people which one they like best and why.

### Week 2 – Logo and look

- Sketch 5 quick logo ideas on paper.
- Pick one and recreate it using a digital tool (Canva, Figma, drawing app).
- Decide on:
  - 1–2 main colors
  - 1 simple font for titles
  - 1 font for normal text

### Week 3 – Your story

Write a short story using this structure:

1. **Problem:** What is happening now?
2. **Why it matters:** Why is this painful or annoying?
3. **Your solution:** What do you do differently?
4. **Future:** What could happen if this works?

Turn it into a short script (about 120–150 words) you can say out loud.

### Week 4 – One-minute pitch

- Practice saying your script while showing your logo or a simple slide.
- Time yourself and adjust so it fits into one minute.
- Present to a friend, family member, or small group.

## Project for this month

Create a “Brand Sheet” that includes:

- Your project name and tagline.
- Your logo in color and in black & white.
- 1–2 main colors and fonts.
- Your one-minute pitch written out.

## Reflection

- How does your brand feel? Calm, fun, serious, playful?
- Does it match the people you want to help?
- What feedback did you get on your name or logo?

## Extra credit

- Design a mock social media post or poster advertising your idea.
- Include your logo, tagline, a short message, and a clear call to action.
