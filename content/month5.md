# Money Matters  
_Pricing, costs, and profit._

## Who is this for?

Students who are ready to think about money in a simple, honest, and realistic
way. You do not need to be “good at math” — we will keep the numbers friendly.

## Learning goals

- Understand the difference between **cost**, **price**, and **profit**.
- List the basic costs for your idea (including your time).
- Pick a starting price and compare with real-world examples.
- Calculate simple profit and break-even points.

## Weekly breakdown

### Week 1 – What does it cost?

- List everything you need to run your idea:
  - Materials (paper, ingredients, tools).
  - Software or subscriptions.
  - Your time (how many hours?).
- Decide which costs are **one-time** and which are **per sale**.

### Week 2 – Setting a price

- Search for similar products or services and write down their prices.
- Decide whether you want to be:
  - Cheaper,
  - Similar,
  - More expensive (with a reason).
- Choose a starting price for your offer.

### Week 3 – Profit and break-even

- For one sale, calculate:

  > **Profit = Price – Cost per sale**

- Next, choose a simple goal, like: “I want to earn \$50.”
- Calculate how many sales you would need to hit that goal.

### Week 4 – What if things change?

Create two quick “What if?” scenarios:

1. Costs go up (for example, supplies cost more).
2. You decide to lower or raise your price.

How does your profit change in each case?

## Project for this month

Create a one-page money plan that includes:

- A table showing:
  - Price, cost per sale, profit per sale.
- Your break-even number of sales.
- A short paragraph explaining your price choice.

## Reflection

- How does it feel to put real numbers on your idea?
- Is your price fair for both you and your customers?
- What would you do if someone said, “That’s too expensive”?

## Extra credit

- Pretend you run your project for 3 months. Make up monthly sales numbers.
- Put them into a simple spreadsheet and create a profit chart.
