# The Build  
_Creating the first version of the product or service._

## Who is this for?

Students who have an idea and some validation and are ready to create a simple
first version, not a perfect final product.

## Learning goals

- Understand what an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is.
- Choose the smallest useful version of your idea.
- Build a basic version using tools you already have.
- Collect feedback and make at least one improvement.

## Weekly breakdown

### Week 1 – What is the smallest useful version?

- List all the features you dream of having.
- Mark each one as **Must have**, **Nice to have**, or **Later**.
- Sketch what your MVP could look like:
  - App: draw screens on paper.
  - Service: write out the steps.
  - Product: draw the item and label the parts.

### Week 2 – Build version 0.1

Choose a simple format for your MVP:

- A basic landing page or prototype website.
- A slide deck that explains the product.
- A script and checklist for a service you will offer.
- A mock-up made with Canva, Figma, or even paper.

Build just enough so someone can understand the idea and how it would help them.

### Week 3 – Test with real people

- Show your MVP to at least 3 people in your target audience.
- Ask:
  - “What is the first thing you notice?”
  - “What is confusing?”
  - “Would you use this? Why or why not?”
- Take notes on what they say, not just what you wish they said.

### Week 4 – Improve one big thing

- Review your notes and pick the **one** change that would help the most.
- Update your MVP with that change:
  - Clearer message?
  - Simpler steps?
  - Better example or screenshot?

## Project for this month

Deliver a working MVP plus a short “Before & After” summary that explains:

- What your first version looked like.
- What feedback you received.
- What you changed and why.

## Reflection

- What was hard about keeping the MVP small?
- What did you want to add that you decided to save for later?
- If you had one more week, what would you improve next?

## Extra credit

- Keep a simple “changelog” with dates and notes each time you update your MVP.
- Share your changelog in your final presentation to show your learning journey.
