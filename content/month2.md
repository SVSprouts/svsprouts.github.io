# Validation  
_Talking to customers and testing assumptions._

## Who is this for?

Students who have picked an idea and want to find out whether other people
actually care about it before they spend lots of time building it.

## Learning goals

- Identify who your potential “customers” or users might be.
- Ask good, open questions instead of jumping straight into a pitch.
- Collect simple data with conversations and a mini survey.
- Decide whether to adjust, improve, or keep your idea.

## Weekly breakdown

### Week 1 – Who might care?

- Describe the person you want to help:
  - How old are they?
  - Where do they hang out (online or offline)?
  - What does a normal day look like for them?
- Write a short paragraph: *“This idea is for…”*

### Week 2 – Designing great questions

- Learn the difference between open questions and closed questions:
  - Closed: “Do you like homework? (yes/no)”
  - Open: “What do you find hardest about homework?”
- Write 6–8 open questions that:
  - Ask about their day.
  - Ask about their problem.
  - Ask what they do today to solve it.

Practice with a friend and adjust anything that sounds confusing.

### Week 3 – Mini survey

- Create a small survey (Google Forms or paper) with:
  - 2–3 multiple-choice questions.
  - 3–4 short-answer questions.
- Aim to get at least **5–10 responses** from people who fit your audience.

### Week 4 – What did we learn?

- Count and summarize answers:
  - Which problems were mentioned the most?
  - Which ideas people liked or disliked?
- Make a simple chart or bullet list with your main findings.
- Decide:
  - **Keep the idea as it is**
  - **Change part of it**
  - **Pivot to a new idea**

## Project for this month

Create a “Validation Summary” that includes:

- Who you talked to and how many people answered your survey.
- 3–5 key quotes or insights you heard.
- One decision you are making about your idea based on the data.

You can present this as a single slide or a one-page document.

## Reflection

- Did anything surprise you about what people said?
- Did anyone disagree with each other?
- How confident do you feel about your idea now (1–10)?

## Extra credit

- Record a 2-minute video explaining:
  - Your idea,
  - What you tested,
  - What you decided to change.
- Share it with a parent, teacher, or mentor and ask for feedback.
