# The Spark  
_Discovering passions and identifying problems worth solving._

## Who is this for?

Middle and high school students who are curious, creative, and want to turn
their interests into real-world projects or businesses.

You do **not** need a perfect idea yet. This month is about exploring and
finding a spark.

## Learning goals

- Identify personal interests, strengths, and values.
- Notice problems and opportunities in your school, home, and community.
- Practice turning complaints into *“How might we…?”* questions.
- Choose one idea to carry forward into the rest of the program.

## Weekly breakdown

### Week 1 – What do I care about?

- Make a list of things you enjoy: hobbies, subjects, games, apps, sports.
- Write about a “perfect day” and what you are doing in it.
- Circle 3–5 themes that show up again and again.

> Reflection: What topics would you be happy to talk about for 30 minutes
> without getting bored?

### Week 2 – Problems around me

- Walk through a normal school day and list every small annoyance.
- Talk to 2–3 friends and ask: “What is something that frustrates you every week?”
- Group problems into categories: school, home, online, community.

### Week 3 – From problem to opportunity

- Choose 3 problems that feel important or interesting to you.
- For each one, rewrite it as a question:
  - “Homework is confusing” → *“How might we make homework easier to understand?”*
- Brainstorm at least 5 quick ideas, even if they seem silly.

### Week 4 – Choosing your project idea

- Create a simple scorecard with three columns: **Fun**, **Useful**, **Doable**.
- Score each idea from 1–5 in each column.
- Pick one idea that scores well and that you are excited about.

## Project for this month

Create a one-page “Spark Sheet” that answers:

1. **The problem:** What is happening now?
2. **Who it affects:** Who feels this problem the most?
3. **Why it matters:** Why is this a big deal?
4. **Your early idea:** How might you help?

You can write this in a doc, slide, or on paper and take a photo.

## Reflection

- What did you learn about what you care about?
- Which problem surprised you the most?
- If you had to explain your idea to a 10-year-old, what would you say?

## Extra credit

- Interview an adult (parent, teacher, coach) about problems they see.
- Ask them which of your ideas they think is most interesting and why.
- Update your Spark Sheet with anything new you learned.
