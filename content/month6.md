# Launch  
_Go live and sell._

## Who is this for?

Students who have an MVP, a brand, and a basic money plan and want to try a
small, safe launch.

Please make sure you follow your family’s and school’s rules for any real
sales or online activity.

## Learning goals

- Plan a simple launch with clear steps and dates.
- Create basic launch materials (messages, posts, demo script).
- Run a small launch event or demo.
- Reflect on results and decide what to do next.

## Weekly breakdown

### Week 1 – Planning the launch

- Decide:
  - **Where** you will launch (school event, family gathering, online demo).
  - **When** it will happen (pick a specific day and time).
  - **Who** you want to invite.
- Make a checklist of tasks you need to finish before launch day.

### Week 2 – Launch materials

Create at least two of these:

- A short message or email inviting people.
- A simple social media style post or flyer.
- A 30–60 second demo script that shows how your project works.

Practice your demo at least twice with a friend or family member.

### Week 3 – Launch week

- Run your launch or demo.
- Keep track of:
  - How many people you talked to.
  - How many sign-ups or sales you got.
  - What questions people asked.

### Week 4 – Debrief and next steps

- Write down 3 things that went well.
- Write down 3 things you would do differently next time.
- Decide whether you want to:
  - Keep running this project,
  - Pause and improve,
  - Or start something new using what you learned.

## Project for this month

Create a “Launch Report” that includes:

- Photos or screenshots from your launch (if allowed).
- Your numbers (conversations, sign-ups, sales).
- The top 3 lessons you learned.
- One clear next step you want to take.

## Reflection

- How did you feel before, during, and after the launch?
- What did you learn about talking to people and sharing your idea?
- What would “success” look like for you one year from now?

## Extra credit

- Write a short “Founder’s Letter” to your future self describing:
  - Why you started,
  - What you learned,
  - What you hope to build in the future.
